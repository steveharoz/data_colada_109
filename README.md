# Steve Haroz's analysis of the calcChain file from DataColada post 109

The original post is here: https://datacolada.org/109

I noticed that DataColada's analysis of calcChain, which shows the order of Excel calculations, was not included in their analysis and was likely done manually. So I did it programmatically and got identical results.
